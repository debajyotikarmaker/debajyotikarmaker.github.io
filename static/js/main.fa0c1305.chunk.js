The flight trajectories of nine Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) were reconstructed in 3D from high speed stereo videography of their flights in an obstacle-free tunnel. Individual birds displayed highly idiosyncratic flight trajectories that were consistent from flight to flight over the course of several months. We then investigated the robustness of each bird\u2019s trajectory by interposing a disk-shaped obstacle in its preferred flight path. We found that each bird continued to fly along its preferred trajectory up to a point very close to the obstacle before veering over the obstacle rapidly, making a minimal deviation to avoid a collision, and subsequently returning to its original path. Thus, Budgerigars show a high propensity to stick to their individual, preferred flight paths even when confronted with a clearly visible obstacle, and do not adopt a substantially different, unobstructed route. The robust preference for idiosyncratic flight paths, and the tendency to pass obstacles by flying above them, provide new insights into the strategies that underpin obstacle avoidance in birds. We believe that this is the first carefully controlled study of the behaviour of birds in response to a newly introduced obstacle in their flight path. The insights from the study could also have implications for conservation efforts to mitigate collisions of birds with man-made obstacles.",url:"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59013-3",projectDetails:""},{images:["dev.png","julia.png","ingo.png","srini.png"],title:"Stretching time and space: How flying Budgerigars evade a moving obstacle",publisher:"Under Review 2020",abstract:"This study investigates whether, and, if so, how, birds use vision to avoid a moving obstacle. Budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulatus, were filmed in 3-D using high-speed video cameras as they flew along a 25m tunnel in which a swinging pendulum, carrying a 41cm disc, presented an oscillating obstacle that moved back and forth across the bird's flight path. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to examine how birds cope with a moving obstacle. Our results reveal that birds approaching the moving pendulum ensure a collision-free passage by always aiming for the visually wider gap at the time of crossing the pendulum. Furthermore, they enhance the safety of the passage through the wider gap by increasing their flight speed slightly when the pendulum is approaching them, and decreasing it slightly when it is receding, thus ensuring that the chosen gap is as wide as possible at the time of transit. These findings provide direct evidence that Budgerigars can identify the wider gap, as well as distinguish whether this gap is currently widening or narrowing. The collision-avoidance scenario investigated here is very different from the well-studied phenomena of birds flying in a flock, or aircraft flying in a formation. There, all of the birds (or aircraft) are flying predominantly in the same direction, making imminent collisions easier to detect and prevent. This study explores a scenario in which a single bird is suddenly confronted by a moving obstacle, say, a tree branch or another bird, approaching from a completely different direction.",url:"",projectDetails:""},{images:["dev.png","julia.png","hong.png","ingo.png","srini.png"],title:"Budgerigar flight: Guidance laws for avoiding an obstacle",publisher:"Under Review, 2020",abstract:"This study investigates how birds (Budgerigars; Melopsittacus undulatus) avoid mid-air collisions by seeking to understand how they identify obstacles and evaluate their threat levels, and to uncover the strategies that they use to avoid collisions with them. In a series of experiments, We presented individual flying birds with three different scenarios: (i) obstacle free flight; (ii) flight past a static mechanical bird; and (iii) flight past a mechanical bird with flapping wings. All experiments were conducted in a purpose-built flight tunnel and the flights were recorded with four synchronized high-speed video cameras. We found that the birds maintained different radial separations from the obstacle, depending on the level of threat that it posed. They consistently passed the mechanical bird at a greater distance when its wings were flapping. The results also suggest that the distance to the mechanical bird is gauged using cues based on optic flow when the wings are stationary, and cues based most likely on image size when the wings are flapping.",url:"",projectDetails:""},{images:["dev.png","srini.png"],title:"Ballistic collision avoidance in Budgerigars",publisher:"Under Review, 2020",abstract:"Birds are agile fliers, that can move rapidly and safely through dense forests and complex environments. We have investigated how birds avoid mid-air collisions while traversing a stationary obstacle, using high-speed stereo video cameras to reconstruct their flight trajectories. Analysis of these trajectories reveals that, when passing the obstacle from above, the birds often use a 'flap-bounding' mode of flight to scale the obstacle. Quantitative modeling indicates that the avoidance trajectory can be characterised accurately by an initial phase in which the bird applies a constant vertical acceleration to gain height, and a subsequent ballistic phase in which the bird closes its wings and passes over the obstacle. The timing and strength of the acceleration phase are evidently tuned precisely to ensure that the maximum altitude is attained at the point of crossing the obstacle, and that a safe, injury-free clearance is achieved. Our findings suggest that the flap-bounding mode of flight, commonly used by many birds for energy-efficient cruising, is recruited by Budgerigars for an additional purpose, namely, obstacle avoidance.",url:"",projectDetails:""}].map((function(e){return n.a.createElement(y,{item:e})}));return n.a.createElement("div",null,n.a.createElement("nav",null,n.a.createElement("div",{className:"nav nav-tabs mt-5   ",id:"nav-tab",role:"tablist"},n.a.createElement("a",{className:"nav-item nav-link active",id:"nav-home-tab","data-toggle":"tab",href:"#nav-home",role:"tab","aria-controls":"nav-home","aria-selected":"true"},"Conference"),n.a.createElement("a",{className:"nav-item nav-link",id:"nav-profile-tab","data-toggle":"tab",href:"#nav-profile",role:"tab","aria-controls":"nav-profile","aria-selected":"false"},"Journals"),n.a.createElement("a",{className:"nav-item nav-link",id:"nav-contact-tab","data-toggle":"tab",href:"#nav-contact",role:"tab","aria-controls":"nav-contact","aria-selected":"false"},"Book Chapter"))),n.a.createElement("div",{className:"tab-content",id:"nav-tabContent"},n.a.createElement("div",{className:"tab-pane fade show active",id:"nav-home",role:"tabpanel","aria-labelledby":"nav-home-tab"},n.a.createElement("div",{className:"jumbotron jumbotron-fluid"},n.a.createElement("div",{className:"d-flex  flex-wrap justify-content-center"},e))),n.a.createElement("div",{className:"tab-pane fade",id:"nav-profile",role:"tabpanel","aria-labelledby":"nav-profile-tab"},"..."),n.a.createElement("div",{className:"tab-pane fade",id:"nav-contact",role:"tabpanel","aria-labelledby":"nav-contact-tab"},"...")))};t(28);var E=function(){return n.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},n.a.createElement(o.a,null,n.a.createElement("nav",{className:"navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light"},n.a.createElement("button",{className:"navbar-toggler",type:"button","data-toggle":"collapse","data-target":"#navbarSupportedContent","aria-controls":"navbarSupportedContent","aria-expanded":"false","aria-label":"Toggle navigation"},n.a.createElement("span",{className:"navbar-toggler-icon"})),n.a.createElement("div",{className:"collapse navbar-collapse",id:"navbarSupportedContent"},n.a.createElement("ul",{className:"navbar-nav m-auto"},n.a.createElement("li",{className:"nav-item"},n.a.createElement(o.b,{className:"nav-link ml-5",to:"/"},"Home")),n.a.createElement("li",{className:"nav-item"},n.a.createElement(o.b,{className:"nav-link ml-5",to:"/research"},"Research")),n.a.createElement("li",{className:"nav-item"},n.a.createElement(o.b,{className:"nav-link ml-5",to:"/software-projects"},"Software Projects")),n.a.createElement("li",{className:"nav-item"},n.a.createElement(o.b,{className:"nav-link ml-5",to:"/publications"},"Curriculum Vitae")),n.a.createElement("li",{className:"nav-item"},n.a.createElement(o.b,{className:"nav-link ml-5",to:"/contacts"},"Contacts"))))),n.a.createElement("div",{className:"container-fluid"},n.a.createElement(l.c,null,n.a.createElement(l.a,{exact:!0,path:"/",component:v}),n.a.createElement(l.a,{path:"/research",component:w}))),n.a.createElement("div",{className:"footer text-center"},"Copyright \xa9 Debajyoti Karmaker 2020")))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));r.a.render(n.a.createElement(n.a.StrictMode,null,n.a.createElement(E,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))}},[[22,1,2]]]);
